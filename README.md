### Assumptions

TO DO: Review for sufficiency / gaps. Validate individual premises. Verify logical sufficiency, validity, and soundness.

Artificial intelligence (AI) instruction-following large language models (IF-LLMs) have [very rapidly emerged in recent years](#timeline-of-emerging-technology-knowledge-and-tools) throughout the general public.

IF-LLMs produce results that are likely considered when making future decisions.

Therefore, IF-LLM results should reasonably satisfy [decision-making information quality criteria](#decision-making-information-quality-criteria-priorities).

Significant misinformation about IF-LLMs (e.g. "hacks", rumors) has circulated through social media and the Internet in recent years.

As a result,  many people in the general public (i.e. not researchers or technology academics) experience difficulty discovering and identifying information about artificial intelligence (AI) instruction-following large language models (IF-LLMs) that is relevant, timely, accurate, reliable, sufficient, and traceable (i.e., satisfies [decision-making information quality criteria](#decision-making-information-quality-criteria-priorities)).

As a result, many IF-LLM users may not understand or use IF-LLMs properly or efficiently to obtain results satisfying their unique priorities, especially [decision-making information quality criteria](#decision-making-information-quality-criteria-priorities).

As a result, many IF-LLM users may unknowingly or begrudgingly experience and transfer greater risk of consequences of inadequate information resulting from [common IF-LLM failures](#common-if-llm-failure-modes).

However, this risk can be greatly reduced by using [various failure mode avoidance strategies](#common-if-llm-failure-mitigation-strategies), which often require better understanding how IF-LLMs work, which user input is helpful, how user input can be better organized to nurture more desirable results, plus how other prompt scaffolding frameworks can improve user efficiency and result quality.


--- TODO: Review and cherry-pick applicable points ---

This appendix contains detailed information about the underlying assumptions for the Instruction-Following Large Language Model Behavior Ontology (IF-LLM-BO) project along with authoritative sources.

Instruction-Following Large Language Models (IF-LLMs) produce results that are likely considered when making decisions. 

Formal priorities are sometimes preferable to informal judgment, especially in high-risk or repeatable workflows. Explicit, ordered priorities improve decision quality during tradeoffs, regardless of the process used (i.e. whether using an IF-LLM or not). Therefore, IF-LLM processing and results for decision-making purposes should use [well-defined quality standards](#decision-making-information-quality-criteria-priorities).

IF-LLMs are complex adaptive systems.

Even with identical instructions, IF-LLM outputs may vary due to:
- Model capability differences
- Instruction formulation quality
- Context window constraints
- System-level limitations

IF-LLM systems do not guarantee perfect determinism. Design goals emphasize **risk reduction and consistency improvement**, not absolute predictability. In other words, it is impossible to eliminate the risk of experiencing undesirable results. However, it is possible to reduce the risks of experiencing undesirable results.

Instructional alignment (i.e. known and controllable for many developers and users) is reflected in **observable output behavior**, not internal model state (i.e. unknown and uncontrollable for most developers and users). 

IF-LLM instructions and contextual information **materially influence** how inputs are interpreted and how outputs are generated.

IF-LLM behavioral correctness is evaluated based on outputs relative to stated instructions, priorities, and constraints.

Instruction-following behavior must be evaluated against stated objectives and priorities. Evaluation criteria must be explicit and observable.

Evaluation results are expected to inform:
- Refinement of instructions
- Updates to knowledge entries
- Adjustments to configurations

Continuous improvement is an assumption, not an optional enhancement.

There is credible and sufficient evidence that Instruction-Following Large Language Models (IF-LLMs) produce a finite number of [common failure modes](#common-if-llm-failure-modes).

Explicit instructions outperform implicit expectations in reducing risks of experiencing common failure modes.

The likelihood for IF-LLM behavioral correctness can be improved and risks of encountering common failure modes can be reduced by incorporating various policies and contextual information into explicit IF-LLM instructions (i.e., [Common IF-LLM Failure Mitigation Strategies](#common-if-llm-failure-mitigation-strategies)).

Instructions and context may be provided by:
- System architects
- Solution developers
- End users

Instruction and context contributors may have different objectives, priorities, and constraints.

IF-LLMs process instructions and context using a **strict authority hierarchy**, where higher-authority instructions override lower-authority inputs (i.e., [Instruction and Context Hierarchy](#instruction-and-context-authority-hierarchy)).

System-level processing policies are authoritative and should not be silently reinterpreted or weakenedto preserve auditability.

Conflicts between instructions must be resolved deterministically according to that hierarchy. Undisclosed or silent overrides reduce reliability and must be avoided.

Human beings are responsible for the following activities related to IF-LLM instructions and context:
- Creating
- Reviewing
- Updating (Maintaining)
- Deleting (Retiring)

[Instructions and contextual elements](#prompt-anatomy) can be stored as **discrete, reusable [knowledge entries](#knowledge-files)**. Knowledge entries can be grouped into **[knowledge files](#knowledge-files)** to improve organization, reuse, and governance.

Knowledge files provided to the model override general model knowledge but do not override system- or developer-level instructions.

Stable identifiers (IDs, tags, handles) for knowledge entries improve traceability, reuse, and auditability over time.

Human-readable structure is preferred over opaque or auto-generated schemas for clarity.

Instructions and contextual elements can be stored as **discrete, reusable [prompt templates](#prompt-templates)**, also stored in a dedicated knowledge file.

Specific combinations of instructions and contextual elements can be stored as **discrete, reusable [configurations](#configurations)**, stored in a dedicated knowledge file too.

Specific arrangements of configurations can be stored as **discrete, reusable [orchestrators](#orchestrators)**, stored in a dedicated knowledge file as well.

Missing, outdated, or uncertain knowledge should be disclosed rather than inferred to ensure auditability.

Refusals, limitations, and uncertainty disclosures are valid and expected outcomes for most IF-LLMs.

When conflicts arise, safety and correctness often override completeness or convenience for most IF-LLMs.

Using a [semi-formal ontology](#background) to establish system-level policies, contextual defaults, and offer reusable, standardized instructions for common use cases can help improve behavioral correctness and reduce risks of encountering common failure modes.

The IF-LLM-BO is a **practical, lightweight semantic scaffolding system**, not a formally complete ontology.

Human usability and behavioral guidance take precedence over theoretical rigor.

The ontology should:
- Minimize unnecessary structure
- Enable incremental improvement
- Surface uncertainty early
- Support small-batch testing and refinement
 
Using an ontology assumes **active governance**, not self-correcting automation.

 Human beings are fallible and may not be consistent.

The effectiveness of any ontology depends on **consistent and disciplined use** by humans, including [governance policies](#policies-governance).

Human beings must take responsibility for creating, reviewing, updating, and deleting [governance policies](#policies-governance). IF-LLM tools should assist human beings to create, review, update, and delete knowledge entries related to knowledge file policies, knowledge entry policies, processing policies, and other knowledge entries while referring to governance policies. This can to improve clarity, completeness, consistency, which ultimately improves behavioral correctness and auditability.

Bypassing or inconsistently applying the ontology reduces reliability but does not invalidate the design.

#### Current Challenges and Proposed Solutions

As of March 2026, [popular instruction-following large language models (IF-LLMs)](#common-if-llms) have demonstrated [various vulnerabilities](#common-if-llm-failure-modes), especially when producing results intended to satisfy [commonly-accepted decision-making information quality criteria](#decision-making-information-quality-criteria-priorities). After [exploring the circumstances and challenges](#assumptions), it seems that more intentionally and consistently using various governance, information policies, processing rules, **plus** reusable instructions and context (information) for common objectives helps reduce the likelihood of undesirable results. 

This eBook explains what IF-LLMs are and how to use them more effectively. The IF-LLM Behavior Ontology (IF-LLM-BO) offers a method of organizing IF-LLM Instruction & Context Architecture (IF-LLM-ICA) elements to align with commonly-accepted best practices as of March 2026.  Together, this available knowledge and tools can help reduce the likelihood of undesirable results while simultaneously increasing the efficiency of system architects, solution developers, and users.

Failure modes and best practices will continue to rapidly evolve over time as IF-LLMs emerge from their infancy, more experience is gained, and models — and their use by the general public — are further researched and refined. This evolution will require routine testing, evaluation, and periodic updates to instructions and context. Also, system architects, solution developers, and power users will begin to standardize and organize policies, instructions, and context (relevant background information) in data files to more efficiently and consistently accomplish more complex objectives while also improving auditability, scalability, scope, and efficiency.

### Timeline of Emerging Technology, Knowledge, and Tools

Before 2022, large language models were primarily used by developers, startups, and researchers. LLMs were primarily accessed via APIs or research demos. Even though some LLMs were powerful, they **did not trigger broad public adoption** because they generally lacked a simple user-interface and strong alignment for following instructions naturally. So awareness was **niche + technical**, not societal.


#### The “ChatGPT moment”

The release of ChatGPT on **November 30, 2022** is widely considered the turning point.

* It made LLMs accessible via a simple chat interface
* It demonstrated **instruction-following + conversational ability** clearly to non-experts
* It went viral almost immediately

Key facts:

* Reached **1 million users in 5 days** and ~100 million in ~2 months ([timelines.issarice.com][1])
* Described as a **“watershed moment” for public AI access** ([Toloka][2])
* Became the **general public’s first hands-on exposure to modern AI capabilities** ([Wikipedia][3])

This is when **public awareness exploded globally**.


#### Emergence of Instruction-Following Large Language Models (IF-LLMs)

The sections below present a timeline of the emergence of **instruction-following large language models (IF-LLMs)** (not just announced or in research, but usable by the general public in some form) up through March 2026.

As of March 2026, the following are commonly used information-following large language models (IF-LLMs).  More detailed information with authoritative sources appear in the [Appendix > IF-LLM Information > Commonly Used IF-LLMs](#commonly-used-if-llms).

- **[OpenAI ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)**
- **[Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/)**
- **[Perplexity AI](https://www.perplexity.ai/)**
- **[Microsoft Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/)**
- **[Claude (Anthropic)](https://claude.ai/)**
- **[Meta AI (Meta Platforms)](https://www.meta.ai/)**
- **[Grok (xAI)](https://grok.x.ai/)**


---

##### Key Pattern

* **Late 2022:** First public exposure (ChatGPT)
* **Q1 2023:** Big Tech rush (Microsoft + Google)
* **Mid–late 2023:** Ecosystem expansion (Anthropic, Meta, xAI)
* **2024+:** Deep integration into platforms and daily workflows

Nearly all major IF-LLMs reached the public **within ~12 months of ChatGPT**, which is unusually fast for a new computing paradigm.

---

#### Transition to Real-World Practical Use

Within months (early 2023), instruction-following large language models (IF-LLM) moved beyond novelty:

* Integration into tools (search engines, coding tools, writing assistants)
* Rapid enterprise adoption
* Emergence of workflows (coding, writing, customer support, education)

Important signals:

* By early 2023, ChatGPT already had ~100M users ([timelines.issarice.com][1])
* The release of GPT-4 (March 2023) significantly improved reliability and usefulness
* Companies began embedding LLMs into products across industries

This is when LLMs **crossed from “demo curiosity” into practical utility**.


---

#### Mass Adoption and Normalization

After the initial shock, usage scaled into everyday infrastructure:

* By mid-2025: ~10% of the world’s adults had used ChatGPT ([cdn.openai.com][4])
* Hundreds of millions of weekly users globally ([JS Interactive][5])
* LLM-assisted writing appears across business, government, and academia ([arXiv][6])

LLMs became:

* A **daily productivity tool** (like email or search)
* Embedded in apps, IDEs, office software, and workflows
* Used by both individuals and organizations

At this stage, they are no longer “new tech”—they’re **general-purpose infrastructure**.


---

#### Timeline Summary

Below is a brief summary for the emergence of large language models (LLMs).

| Phase               | Period             | What changed                 |
| ------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Research phase      | 2018–2021          | Powerful but niche, API-only |
| Breakthrough moment | **Nov–Dec 2022**   | Public awareness explodes    |
| Practical adoption  | **Early–mid 2023** | Real-world workflows emerge  |
| Mass normalization  | 2023–2025          | Becomes everyday tool        |

The transition was not gradual—it was **step-function-like**:

* **Technical capability matured earlier (2020–2022)**
* But **usability + alignment + interface (ChatGPT)** triggered:

  * Immediate public comprehension
  * Viral adoption
  * Rapid integration into daily work

In other words: **LLMs became “real” to the world not when they got smart enough—but when they became usable.**

### What is an Instruction-Following Large Language Model (IF-LLM)?


#### A Well-Trained Assistant

Imagine you’re working with a really attentive assistant:

* You say: *“Write a polite email asking for a refund.”*
* Or: *“Explain photosynthesis like I’m in 5th grade.”*
* Or even: *“Give me a grocery list for a healthy week on a budget.”*

A good assistant listens carefully, understands what you mean, and responds in a way that matches your request.

An **instruction-following large language model (IF-LLM) does something very similar**, but using artificial intelligence.


---

#### A Simple Analogy

Think of an IF-LLM like:

> A giant library + a helpful librarian
> who listens to your question and quickly pulls together an answer in your preferred style.


---

#### **“Language Model” = A Pattern Learner for Words**

An IF-LLM is trained on massive amounts of text—books, websites, conversations—so it learns:

* How people use language
* How ideas are explained
* What answers typically look like

It doesn’t “think” like a human, but it’s very good at recognizing patterns in language.


---

#### **“Instruction-Following” = It Listens to What You Ask**

What makes this type of model special is that it’s trained to:

* Understand **instructions or requests**
* Adjust its response based on **your goal, tone, and context**

So instead of just predicting text, it tries to **do what you asked it to do**.


---

#### Real-Life Examples

Here’s how people across different communities might use an IF-LLM:

* **Job seekers:** “Help me rewrite my resume for a warehouse job.”
* **Parents:** “Explain algebra homework in simple terms.”
* **Small business owners:** “Write a social media post promoting my food truck.”
* **Healthcare workers:** “Summarize this patient info in plain language.”

In each case, the model adapts to the instruction.


---

#### Why It Matters

From an education and workforce perspective, IF-LLMs can:

* Support **learning at any age or level**
* Help people **communicate more effectively**
* Save time on everyday tasks (writing, planning, explaining)
* Act like an **on-demand tutor or assistant**


---

#### Important to Know

Even though IF-LLMs are powerful:

* They **don’t truly understand** things like humans do
* They can sometimes give **incorrect or outdated information**
* They work best when **your instructions are clear**


---

### Fundamental IF-LLM Elements: Instructions, Context, and Tools




---

This and the following sections briefly describe the most important elements of instruction-following large language models (IF-LLMs).

- [**Instruction-Following Large Language Model (IF-LLM)**](#instruction-following-large-language-model-if-llm) → interprets and executes instructions using the given context and available tools (e.g., [Common IF-LLMs](#common-if-llms))
  - [**Prompt**](#prompt) → tells the model what to do (i.e., instructions and context)
  - [**Knowledge Files**](#knowledge-files) → provide reliable information (i.e., saved, reusable instructions and context)
  - [**Tools**](#tools) → access external data and tools to extend the model's capabilities
  - **Output** → response after executing the instructions using the given context and available tools

**Analogy**: A **chef (IF-LLM)** follows a **recipe (prompt)**, uses a **cookbook (knowledge files)**, and operates **kitchen equipment (tools)** to produce a **meal (output)**.

The following sections will briefly expand on these foundational IF-LLM elements.

**Note**
- IF-LLMs typically separate and process system, developer, and user instructions per the [Instruction and Context Authority Hierarchy](#instruction-and-context-authority-hierarchy). This is more evident when using IF-LLMs via Application Programming Interface (APIs) versus web or chat interfaces. Meaning, instructions have three layers: system, developer, and user.
- Instructions and context may come from prompt input, knowledge files (from system architects, solution developers, or users), tool results (including retrieved and generated content), conversation history, and stored memories from other conversations. Meaning, user input, knowledge files, and examples are simply three of many important channels for context/grounding, which also include tool results, retrieved and generated content, conversation history, plus stored memories.
- Examples are critical prompt elements, often called "few-shot examples", that help guide IF-LLMs toward desirable responses.

More detailed information is available in the [Appendices > IF-LLM Information > Common Model Elements](#common-elements-instructions-context-and-tools).


---

#### Instruction-Following Large Language Model (IF-LLM)

**Description:** A software system (e.g., [common IF-LLMs](#common-if-llms)) designed to interpret and execute instructions provided in prompts.

**Purpose:** To process user instructions and generate useful, relevant, and structured outputs.

**Role:** The IF-LLM is the **executor**. Unlike prompts (instructions), knowledge files (information), and tools (capabilities), the IF-LLM is the entity that **uses all of them together**.

**Analogy:** Like a **chef in a kitchen**, follows recipes (prompts), uses ingredients (knowledge), and operates equipment (tools).

**Example:** “Your favorite IF-LLM reads your request for a grilled cheese recipe and produces step-by-step instructions.”


---

#### **Prompt**

**Description:** The set of instructions, context, and constraints given to the IF-LLM.

**Purpose:** To guide the model’s behavior, define the task, and shape the output.

**Role:** The prompt is the **director or script**. Unlike the IF-LLM (executor), knowledge files (stored, reusable instructions and context data provided by system architects, solution developers, or users), or tools (actions), the prompt includes user-entered instructions and context to define **what should be done and how**.

**Analogy:** Like a **recipe given to a chef**, tells the chef what dish to make, how to prioritize taste, safety, and simplicity.

**Example:** “You are a well-respected chef… Describe how to make a grilled cheese sandwich prioritizing safety, taste, and affordability.”


---

#### **Knowledge Files**

**Description:** External or provided documents/data that the IF-LLM can use as instructions or context (e.g., an uploaded `system-policies-processing.md` with instructions and context related to system-level processing policies provided by the system architect).

**Purpose:** To provide **grounded, authoritative information** that improves accuracy and reliability.

**Role:** Knowledge files are the **source of truth**. Unlike prompts (user-entered instructions and context), tools (actions), or the IF-LLM (processor), knowledge files supply **reusable and verified instructions and context**.

**Analogy:** Like a **cookbook or reference manual** in a kitchen, the chef consults it to ensure correct techniques and facts.

**Example:** Using a digital file containing system-level processing policies (`system-policies-processing.md`) provided by the system architect to ensure responses follow rules like:
  - “Do not guess”
  - “Provide structured output”
  - “Disclose uncertainty”


---

#### **Tools**

**Description:** External capabilities the IF-LLM can use to extend functionality (e.g., search, calculations, file access).

**Purpose:** To obtain missing information, perform actions, or increase reliability beyond the model’s internal knowledge and included knowledge files.

**Role:** Tools are the **capabilities or instruments**. Unlike prompts (user-provided instructions and context), knowledge files (stored, reusable instructions and context), or the IF-LLM (processor), tools enable **interaction with the outside world or specialized functions**.

**Analogy:** Like **kitchen equipment**, a stove, blender, or thermometer helps the chef do things they couldn’t do with just a coordinator using instructions and context alone.

**Examples**
  - Using a web search tool to find current restaurant hours.
  - Using a calculator tool to compute nutritional values.

- Evidence & Verification Failures
- Safety, Alignment & Preference Failures
- Security & Adversarial Robustness Failures
- Context & Information Utilization Failures
- Instruction Interpretation & Constraint Compliance Failures
- Task Execution & Objective Fulfillment Failures

### Decision-Making Information Quality Criteria (Priorities)

[Instruction-following large language models (IF-LLMs)](#common-if-llms) are often used to generate information that can influence decisions impacting people and other systems. Because of this, the responses they produce should meet clear and well-defined quality standards. Therefore, IF-LLMs should prioritize these quality standards according to their ranked importance. Any trade-offs should be disclosed to users. Meaning, the [instructions and context guiding IF-LLMs](#common-if-llm-elements-instructions-context-and-tools) — especially the system-level policies — should reflect and reinforce these priorities.

The priorities listed below identify the key criteria that information should have in order to reliably support decision-making. Each definition answers a practical question: *"What does this mean for everyday decision-making?"*

 1. **Auditability:** source of information, how information was changed, and who handled information can be identified.
 2. **Relevance:** information matters for the decision being made and helps improve that decision. It connects directly to the question, problem, or goal at hand. Relevant information helps you decide; irrelevant information does not—even if it is interesting or true.
 3. **Timeliness:** information is up to date and available when it is needed. Information that is too old or arrives too late loses its usefulness. Good information comes at the right time—not after the decision is already over.
 4. **Accuracy:** information is correct and matches reality. Facts are right, numbers are right, and statements reflect what is actually true. If something is accurate, you can trust that it isn’t wrong, misleading, or made up.
 5. **Reliability:** information can be trusted to be dependable, honest, and consistent over time. Reliable information is not biased or misleading, comes from a credible source, and holds up when checked or used again.
 6. **Sufficiency:** there is enough information—no important pieces are missing, and there is not unnecessary overload. The amount and level of detail fit the decision. You have what you need to decide, without being overwhelmed or left guessing.
 7. **Compliance:** information follows required laws, rules, standards, and policies. It meets formal obligations and expectations. Compliant information plays by the rules it is supposed to follow.
 8. **Clarity:** information is easy to understand, clearly explained, and not confusing. The meaning is obvious without special knowledge or extra interpretation. Clear information makes sense the first time you read or hear it.
 9. **Fairness:** information is unbiased, balanced, and considers different perspectives. It is not slanted to favor one group, outcome, or opinion unfairly. Fair information doesn’t “stack the deck” or leave out voices that matter.
10. **Consistency:** information does not contradict itself and follows the same logic, terms, and structure throughout. Similar things are treated the same way. Consistent information doesn’t change its story halfway through.
11. **Efficiency:** information can be accessed and used with reasonable effort, time, and cost. People can get what they need without unnecessary barriers. Efficient information is easy to find and use without wasting time or energy.
12. **Security:** information is protected from unauthorized access, misuse, or harm. Only the right people can see or change it. Secure information is kept safe from people who should not have it.
13. **Recoverability:** information can be restored if it is lost, damaged, or disrupted. Systems can bounce back after problems. If something goes wrong, the information isn’t gone forever.
14. **Flexibility:** information can be used in more than one situation or adapted to different needs without losing meaning. Flexible information still works when the situation changes slightly.

#### Common Elements: Instructions, Context, and Tools

A brief foundational summary of common instruction-following large language model (IF-LLM) elements was presented in the [Project Notes](#if-llm-bo-project-notes) > [Foundations](#foundations) > [Common IF-LLM Elements: Instructions and Context](#common-if-llm-elements-instructions-context-and-tools). The following sections expand the foundational elements into [basic](!!!TODO!!!), [intermediate](!!!TODO!!!), and [advanced IF-LLM elements](!!!TODO!!!).

As stated in the previous section, the foundational IF-LLM elements are as follows:
- [**Instruction-Following Large Language Model (IF-LLM)**](#instruction-following-large-language-model-if-llm) → interprets and executes instructions using the given context and available tools (e.g., [Common IF-LLMs](#common-if-llms))
  - [**Prompt**](#prompt) → tells the model what to do (i.e., instructions and context)
  - [**Knowledge Files**](#knowledge-files) → provide reliable information (i.e., saved, reusable instructions and context)
  - [**Tools**](#tools) → access external data and tools to extend the model's capabilities
  - **Output** → response after executing the instructions using the given context and available tools

**Analogy**: A **chef (IF-LLM)** follows a **recipe (prompt)**, uses a **cookbook (knowledge files)**, and operates **kitchen equipment (tools)** to produce a **meal (output)**.

**Note**
- Models typically separate and process system, developer, and user instructions per the [Instruction and Context Authority Hierarchy](#instruction-and-context-authority-hierarchy). This is more evident when using IF-LLM via APIs versus web interfaces. Meaning, instructions have three layers: system, developer, and user.
- Instructions and context may come from prompt input, knowledge files (from system architects, solution developers, or users), tool results (including retrieved and generated content), conversation history, and stored memories from other conversations. Meaning, user input, knowledge files, and examples are simply three of many important channels for context/grounding, which also include tool results, retrieved and generated content, conversation history, plus stored memories.
- Examples are critical prompt elements, often called "few-shot examples", that help guide  models toward desirable responses.



#### Instruction and Context Authority Hierarchy

TODO: Briefly define the hierarchy of IF-LLM instructions and knowledge authority as outlined below, including how instructions are granted authority, critical phrases used to grant/assign authority, plus 3 to 5 examplesto help users understand the value of this hierarchy.
1. System Instructions and Context (Global Policies and Context) (e.g., knowledge entries with the highest authority (i.e., meta knowledge entries))
2. Developer Instructions and Context (e.g., knowledge entries with the second-highest authority, developer implemented knowledge entries)
3. User Instructions and Context (i.e., the current conversation via chat or API, which could reference existing knowledge entries)
4. Knowledge Files (and their collection of entries)
5. User-Uploaded Files (e.g., user-uploaded files, which are considered user knowledge files containing user knowledge injuries)
6. Tool Outputs
7. General Model Knowledge

IF-LLMs receive instructions through either user prompts (e.g., chat interfaces or APIs) or developer instructions. Users and developers can store reusable instructions and context in knowledge entries of various types. Knowledge entries can be organized into knowledge files.

  - [**Prompt**](!!!TODO!!!) → tells the model what to do (i.e., instructions and context)
    - [**Identity and Role**](!!!TODO!!!) → aligns the model’s behavior, tone, and decision-making with the intended use case and constraints (including audience and objective)
    - [**Task**](!!!TODO!!!) → ensures the model executes the correct actions in an organized and logical order (including priorities and workflow)
    - [**Context**](!!!TODO!!!) → improves accuracy, relevance, and grounding of the response (i.e., relevant information)
    - [**Response Criteria**](!!!TODO!!!) → ensures output quality, consistency, and alignment with expectations (including rules and success criteria)
    - [**Response Example**](!!!TODO!!!) → reduces ambiguity and improves alignment by showing a concrete reference
  - [**Knowledge Files**](!!!TODO!!!) → provide reliable information (i.e., reusable context) (e.g., uploaded files)
  - [**Tools**](!!!TODO!!!) → access external data and tools to extend the model's capabilities
    - **Information Retrieval Tools** (includes citations)
    - **Multimodal Access, Analysis, and Creation Tools** (e.g., text, images, audio, video)
    - **File (Document) Access, Analysis, and Creation Tools**
  - **Output** → response after executing the instructions using the given context and available tools

**Analogy**: A **chef (IF-LLM)** follows a **recipe (prompt)**, uses a **cookbook (knowledge files)**, and operates **kitchen equipment (tools)** to produce a **meal (output)**.


---

###### Identity and Role

**Description:** A grouped set of elements that define who the model is, who it serves, what it aims to achieve, and what matters most.

**Purpose:** Aligns the model’s behavior, tone, and decision-making with the intended use case and constraints.

**Role:** Unlike Task & Workflow (what to do) or Response Criteria (how to judge success), this group defines the **strategic framing and alignment** of the response.

**Analogy:** Choosing the **chef type (identity/role), guest (audience), goal (objective), and cooking preferences (priorities)** before cooking begins.

**Example:** “You are a financial advisor helping middle-income families (audience) reduce debt (objective), prioritizing clarity and practicality (priorities).”


---

###### Task

**Description:** Defines the specific actions to perform and the sequence or steps to follow.

**Purpose:** Ensures the model executes the correct actions in an organized and logical order.

**Role:** Unlike Identity group (who/why) or Context (background), this defines **what to do and in what order**.

**Analogy:** A **recipe with step-by-step instructions** for preparing a dish.

**Example:** “Analyze the problem, break it into steps, and provide a step-by-step solution.”


---

###### Context

**Description:** Provides supporting information, constraints, or background needed to complete the task accurately. May reference uploaded knowledge files.

**Purpose:** Improves accuracy, relevance, and grounding of the response.

**Role:** Unlike Task (instructions), context provides **supporting information and constraints** that inform how the task is performed.

**Analogy:** Ingredients, kitchen conditions, or dietary restrictions available to the chef.

**Example:** “The user has a monthly income of $3,000 and $10,000 in debt.”



---

###### Response Criteria

**Description:** Defines the rules, constraints, and standards that determine whether the response is successful.

**Purpose:** Ensures output quality, consistency, and alignment with expectations.

**Role:** Unlike Task (what to do) or Structure (how to format), this defines **how good output is evaluated**.

**Analogy:** Judging criteria in a **cooking competition** (taste, presentation, nutrition).

**Example:** “Ensure the answer is accurate, concise, and easy to understand.”


---

###### Response Example

**Description:** A sample output demonstrating what a correct or ideal response looks like.

**Purpose:** Reduces ambiguity and improves alignment by showing a concrete reference.

**Role:** Unlike Response Criteria (rules), this provides a **concrete demonstration of success**.

**Analogy:** Showing a **finished plated dish** as a reference for what to create.

**Example:**
  - Input: “Explain budgeting”
  - Output: “Budgeting is the process of tracking income and expenses to manage finances effectively.”

### Comprehensive Architecture for Critical Needs

TODO


---


### Instruction Elements (Scaffolding)

The scaffolding so far is as follows:
- **ontology:** *serves as the semantic root for all model behavior.* The ontology defines the canonical concepts, relationships, and behavior guidance that constitute the instruction-following LLM’s shared semantic foundation.
  - **meta:** *provides cross-cutting rules and scaffolding about the ontology itself.* Meta captures naming rules, modeling conventions, global decision policies, ontology versioning, glossaries of meta-terms, and core primitives reused across domains.
  - **tasks:** *defines what the model is expected to do and how success is judged.* Tasks specify objectives, priorities, success criteria, unacceptable outputs, scope boundaries, and workflows, providing explicit guidance on intended outcomes and failure avoidance.
  - **domains:** *constrain what knowledge space the model may operate within.* Domains describe relevant elements and relationships, in-scope and out-of-scope topics, geographic or contextual boundaries, and known uncertainty zones to reduce ambiguity and hallucination.
  - **experts:** *shape how the model reasons about the task.* Experts encode reasoning frameworks, heuristics, and analytical lenses that guide interpretation, tradeoffs, and decision-making without prescribing exact answers.
  - **structures:** *control how outputs are organized and validated.* Structures define required sections, ordering, mandatory and conditional fields, and formatting rules to ensure consistency, completeness, and evaluability of responses.
  - **personas:** *govern how the model communicates.* Personas specify tone, voice, formality, conciseness, and stylistic constraints, aligning outputs with audience expectations without altering underlying task logic.
  - **examples:** *demonstrate acceptable patterns of behavior.* Examples pair representative prompts with corresponding results to illustrate desired reasoning, structure, and boundary handling in concrete terms.
  - **configs:** *compose a complete behavioral profile.* Configurations bind tasks, domains, experts, structures, personas, and examples into a reusable, explicit behavioral setup that enables consistent instruction-following across contexts.

### Work in Progress
this IF-LLM Behavior Ontology (IFLLMBO) is intended to be a lightweight, LLM-legible semantic scaffolding system for organizing knowledge files and entries that ensure tools are more likely to offer results that are more accurate, reliable, relevant, specific, clear, practical, fair, and efficient.

It prioritizes human-readable structure, stable identifiers, and explicit decision guidance over formal ontology rigor, enabling consistent reasoning and behavior across AI-assisted workflows.

#### Prompt Templates, Orchestrators, Configurations
TBD

Specific combinations of [instructions and contextual prompt elements](#prompt-1) can be written as **discrete, reusable [behavior configurations](!!!TODO!!!)** (i.e., [specific knowledge entries](#knowledge-files-1) that define [behavior configurations](!!!TODO!!!), which are stored in a dedicated knowledge file for easy reuse). Think of a behavior configuration as a specialized chef responsible for a specific course of a multi-course meal with a particular theme for a given audience. The behavior configuration has a single objective, specific priorities, plus fairly common parameters defining the task (e.g., workflow), domains (i.e., knowledge), reasoning, structure, persona, and example elements. In this case, the executive chef is assigning the specialized chef to prepare the Aperitivo course for an Italian/American-fusion-themed meal for Italian diplomats.

Specific arrangements of [behavior configurations](!!!TODO!!!) can be stored as **discrete, reusable [orchestrators](#orchestrators)** (i.e., [specific knowledge entries](#knowledge-files-1) that define [orchestrators](!!!TODO!!!), which are also stored in a dedicated knowledge file for easy reuse). Think of orchestrators as an executive chef guiding a team of specialized chefs, each responsible for a specific course of a multi-course Italian meal (e.g., Aperitivo, Antipasto, Primo, etc.). The objective of the orchestrator is to prepare a multi-course meal based on the request of the event host (the end-user). Once the orchestrator receives the host's request, the orchestrator distributes the work among the necessary configurations of specialized chefs. The host might request an Italian, Chinese, or Ethiopian theme for a five course meal for national leaders, tourists, or cultural event attendees. Different requests require different knowledge, techniques, supplies, equipment, and presentation. Orchestrators can easily handle assigning then validating the results of each behavior configuration before providing a response to the end-user.

Instructions and contextual elements can be stored as **discrete, reusable [prompt templates](#prompt-templates)**, also stored in a dedicated knowledge file. Think of prompt templates as a event hosting manual used by executive chefs (orchestrator) or a meal course plan used by a specialized chef (behavior configuration). Instructions and context within templates can often be tailored depending on the circumstances (e.g., Italian, Chinese, Ethiopian, etc. theme; five- or seven-course meal; for national leaders, tourists, or charity event participants) then assigned to the necessary orchestrator(s), behavioral configuration(s), or directly to the model. 

By leveraging prompt templates, orchestrators, behavioral configurations, along with foundational, basic, intermediate, or advanced IF-LLM elements, users are able to quickly and easily submit requests to consistently accomplish complex objectives given specific priorities requiring multiple tasks, each with unique specifications (e.g. workflows, domains, reasoning, structures, personas, examples). System architects and solution developers can configure, test, refine, and validate prompt templates, orchestrators, behavioral configurations, and other elements based on their scope of interest and expertise, thereby quickly scaling the opportunities available for end-users. By sharing their unique scaffolding elements, architects and developers across our many, widespread, and diverse communities can contribute to a universal, scalable, and maintainable system offering quick and easy prompts that offer safe and reliable responses for users to address a wide variety of needs.

More detailed information about these rules can be found in the [Appendix: IF-LLM  Information](#appendix-if-llm-information) > [Common Elements: Instructions, Context, and Tools](#common-elements-instructions-context-and-tools).

- ChatGPT and Gemini form the **first-year** IF-LLM Perplexi hosts/developers.
- Perplexity, Copilot, and Claude form a **second tier** with tens to hundreds of millions of users.
- Meta AI and Grok are ecosystem-dependent and emerging
- Interpretation
  - Ranking is based on **traffic + market share + user estimates combined**, since no single standardized metric exists across all providers.
- Material Tradeoffs & Limitations (Required Disclosure)
  - **Metric inconsistency:** Sources mix **visits, unique users, DAUs, and market share**, which are not directly comparable.
  - **Platform integration bias:** Tools embedded in ecosystems (Google, Microsoft, Meta) may have **underreported or differently measured usage**.
  - **Timeliness vs. reliability tradeoff:** Using recent (2025–2026) data improves relevance but introduces **variation across datasets and methodologies**.
  - **Stakeholder impact:** Rankings may influence business or personal tool choices; uncertainty could affect decisions.

  * **Knowledge Boundary Failure**

    * **Examples**

      * The model attempts to answer questions even when the topic is outside its training knowledge.
      * Instead of saying “I don’t know,” the system may guess or speculate.
      * Models may provide outdated or incomplete information when asked about recent events.
      * AI systems may fail to recognize when they lack enough context or reliable data to answer correctly.

  * **Overconfidence in Weak Reasoning**

    * **Examples**

      * The model gives a confident explanation that sounds convincing but is logically incorrect.
      * A chatbot produces detailed reasoning even when the conclusion is wrong.
      * The system agrees with a user’s incorrect assumption and builds a confident explanation around it.
      * Explanations may appear coherent and well-structured but rely on incomplete or flawed reasoning.

* **Robustness, Stability & Training Trade-off Failures**

  * **Consistency / Stability Failure**

    * **Examples**

      * The same question asked twice can produce different answers, even when nothing else changes.
      * Small wording changes in a prompt lead to dramatically different responses.
      * The model contradicts earlier statements within the same conversation.
      * Results vary depending on prompt formatting, order of information, or context length.

  * **Alignment Tax / Capability Regression (implicit risk)**

    * **Examples**

      * Safety alignment can sometimes reduce model performance on reasoning, coding, or factual tasks.
      * A model may refuse harmless requests because safety filters are overly strict.
      * Alignment updates occasionally degrade previously strong capabilities.
      * Fine-tuning for safety or helpfulness can introduce new errors or reduce accuracy in specialized tasks.
      * Improvements to alignment may create trade-offs between safety, usefulness, and performance.
      * Some models perform worse on certain benchmarks after safety-focused training.
      * Developers must balance safety improvements with maintaining technical capabilities.

* **Evidence & Verification Failures**

  * **Unsupported Claims**

    * **Examples**

      * The model states facts or conclusions without providing any evidence or reliable source.
      * A chatbot presents statistics or scientific findings but cannot identify where the information came from.
      * The system makes confident claims about medical, legal, or policy topics without supporting documentation.
      * The model summarizes research results that are not traceable to a real study.
      * The explanation sounds reasonable but does not link to verifiable data or references.
      * The model mixes opinions and factual statements without clearly distinguishing them.
      * Users may assume statements are evidence-based when they are actually generated guesses.

      * The system fails to follow instructions about length limits or specific output structures.
      * The model returns incorrect JSON, code, or structured data when a strict format is required.
      * The response does not follow requested ordering or section headings.
      * Even when constraints are clear, the model sometimes partially follows them.

  * **Overgeneralization or Over-Literalism**

    * **Examples**

      * The model applies a rule too broadly and produces an incorrect answer.
      * A chatbot interprets instructions too literally and ignores the intended meaning.
      * The system extends patterns beyond what the prompt actually states.
      * The model follows wording exactly but misses the practical intent of the request.
      * General instructions are applied rigidly even when exceptions should be obvious.
      * The system over-applies examples in the prompt and assumes they represent universal rules.

* **Task Execution & Objective Fulfillment Failures**

  * **Task Completeness Failure**

    * **Examples**

      * The model answers only part of a multi-step request and ignores other required steps.
      * A chatbot provides an incomplete list when the user asked for all relevant items.
      * The system begins solving a task but stops before completing the full solution.
      * The model summarizes only some sections of a document instead of the entire content requested.
      * A response addresses the main question but omits required formatting, details, or follow-up actions.
      * The model performs an analysis but fails to provide the final conclusion requested by the user.
      * In structured tasks (reports, tables, or code), the output is partially completed or missing sections.

### Decision-Making Information Quality Criteria (Priorities) with Definitions and Sources

TODO: Review and Revise

This appendix describes the decision-making information quality criteria and definitions used in the Information-Following Large Language Model Behavior Ontology (IF-LLM-BO) project. This appendix expands on the [Decision-Making Information Quality Criteria (Priorities)](#decision-making-information-quality-criteria-priorities). The criteria and definitions are based on terms used in various [authoritative sources](#summary-of-authoritative-sources-for-decision-making-information-quality-criteria-priorities).

Instruction-following large language models (IF-LLMs) are often used to generate information that influence decisions impacting people and other systems. Because of this, the responses they produce should meet clear and well-defined quality standards. The quality standards listed below identify the key criteria that information should have in order to reliably support decision-making. To produce information that meaningfully supports decisions, IF-LLMs should prioritize these criteria according to their ranked importance. Any trade-offs should be disclosed to users. In turn, the policies and procedures governing IF-LLM-BO systems should be designed to reflect and reinforce these priorities. The criteria listed below are shown in their order of importance; their priorities.

The criteria and definitions presented here are **synthesized from the cited authoritative sources**. Each definition is written to answer a practical question: *“What does this mean for everyday decision-making?”*

- **Auditability:** source of information, how information was changed, and who handled information can be identified.
  - *Sources*
    - *Traceability* in **ISO.** *ISO 25012: Software Engineering—Software Product Quality Requirements and Evaluation (SQuaRE)—Data Quality Model.* International Organization for Standardization, 2008.
- **Relevance:** information matters for the decision being made and helps improve that decision. It connects directly to the question, problem, or goal at hand. Relevant information helps you decide; irrelevant information does not—even if it is interesting or true.
  - *Sources*
    - *Relevance* and *Value* in **O’Brien, James A., and George M. Marakas.** *Management Information Systems.* 10th ed., McGraw-Hill/Irwin, 2011.
    - *Relevance* and *Value-added* in **Wang, Richard Y., and Diane M. Strong.** “Beyond Accuracy: What Data Quality Means to Data Consumers.” *Journal of Management Information Systems*, vol. 12, no. 4, 1996, pp. 5–33.
    - *Relevance* in **Eppler, Martin J.** *Managing Information Quality: Increasing the Value of Information in Knowledge-Intensive Products and Processes.* Springer, 2006.
    - *Relevance* and *Significance* in **Paul, Richard, and Linda Elder.** *The Miniature Guide to Critical Thinking: Concepts and Tools.* Foundation for Critical Thinking, 2008.
- **Timeliness:** information is up to date and available when it is needed. Information that is too old or arrives too late loses its usefulness. Good information comes at the right time—not after the decision is already over.
  - *Sources*
    - *Currentness* in **ISO.** *ISO 25012: Software Engineering—Software Product Quality Requirements and Evaluation (SQuaRE)—Data Quality Model.* International Organization for Standardization, 2008.

    - *Timeliness*, *Up-to-dateness*, and *Frequency* in **Eppler, Martin J.** *Managing Information Quality: Increasing the Value of Information in Knowledge-Intensive Products and Processes.* Springer, 2006.
- **Accuracy:** information is correct and matches reality. Facts are right, numbers are right, and statements reflect what is actually true. If something is accurate, you can trust that it isn’t wrong, misleading, or made up.

    - **Paul, Richard, and Linda Elder.** *The Miniature Guide to Critical Thinking: Concepts and Tools.* Foundation for Critical Thinking, 2008.
- **Reliability:** information can be trusted to be dependable, honest, and consistent over time. Reliable information is not biased or misleading, comes from a credible source, and holds up when checked or used again.
  - *Sources*
    - *Credibility* in **ISO.** *ISO 25012: Software Engineering—Software Product Quality Requirements and Evaluation (SQuaRE)—Data Quality Model.* International Organization for Standardization, 2008.

    - *Fairness* in **Paul, Richard, and Linda Elder.** *The Miniature Guide to Critical Thinking: Concepts and Tools.* Foundation for Critical Thinking, 2008.
- **Sufficiency:** there is enough information—no important pieces are missing, and there is not unnecessary overload. The amount and level of detail fit the decision. You have what you need to decide, without being overwhelmed or left guessing.
